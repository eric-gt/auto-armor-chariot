The leading player clears a peril of mechanical or physical origin from a character or construct, or swaps an [[Astir]] part out for one you already have. They frame a short scene around this, either alone or with invited characters.
During the scene, anyone may spend a token to choose one:

- Clear a [[peril]] or swap a part, as above.
- Help someone you have [[GRAVITY]] with, advancing it. 
- Start or advance a long-term project: describe what your work looks like. 
- Take their Astir and rush ahead: you’ll [[Lead a Sortie]] with +[[Traits#DEFY|DEFY]] & [[Advantage]].

When you rush ahead, this doesn’t end the [[Downtime]]: other [[Scene|Scenes]] can be played chronologically before this one, and the crew might also just not spring into action in your wake.
