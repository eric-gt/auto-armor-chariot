## [[Session Notes]]
### [[Roleplay]]
*Interior Shot*: a black steam powered car with bench seats. [[The Gang]] sit with [[Kai Lete Lawa]] on their way to [[The Winter Palace]]. 
Kai: 
> To be clear, I'm asking for Mister [[Isaac Was'utala Wasomun|Wasomun]] here to be the captain, for Mister [[Yuri Artorianova|Artorianova]] to be the diplomat on board, and for Mister [[Jesse Anderson|Anderson]] and Miss [[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]] to serve as your [[Channeler]] complement...Nobody was our first choice for the position, but every one of you  is competent, and many are excellent

Until the program is proven, [[The Tomoteloman Monarchy|the Monarchy]] does not want to release new recruits. Kai is taking the gang to meet with the rest of the [[Senior Staff]]. 

*Exterior Shot* An enormous, palatial estate with high walls butting up against the city. A uniformed soldier with a rifle slung over their shoulder speaks with the car's driver and waves us past, as another soldier opens the wrought iron gate. The car drives up a long driveway to an enormous Victorian style mansion, a square building with a courtyard in the center, full of imported grass and goats trimming the lawn. Other non-native trees and flowers are tended to by a groundkeeping staff. The party exits the car.

Kai:
> Well...welcome to the Winter Palace. Really rather silly to have a winter palace in a place where we don't get  much winter, but it was all the fashion when my grandfather built it. Or rather, when my grandfather ordered it built. The real people who raised the walls and set the nails are lost to history. Kind of funny isn't it?

They look expectantly at Isaac and Yuri, gauging their responses. Yuri says "quite right on that second point." Isaac says something about how "it's a shame they never had the opportunity to decide the direction of their own country". Kai smiles a polite, restrained style.

The group moves inside, past functionaries and nobles dressed anywhere from traditional [[Tomoteloma|tomoteloman]] garb to 19th century suits (very sweaty). Most are wearing a blend of styles suited for the heat, much like Kai. 

*Interior* Kai's office is large and filled with books in glass fronted cases. The books are obviously curated, not ordered by the yard like some nobles. Political theory, sociology...a rare collection of traditional tomoteloman poetry jumps out at Isaac as he peruses the stack alongside Omma. There are two desks, the smaller occupied by a secretary, the larger by a window that looks out over the palace wall to the city cascading out downwards to the ocean. Their desk faces the window, not the door. A large couch and several chairs surround a small coffee table, all hand-carved dark wood and deep red upholstery, and golden aglets. Looking closely, there is a paisley pattern embroidered into the fabric. Hot pots of coffee and tea sit upon the coffee table, and lounging in the chairs are the rest of the [[Senior Staff]]:

- [[Carolyn Jack]]: First mate. A tomoteloman calico catgirl  dressed in a [[Tomoteloman Republic]] military uniform
- [[Leo Socorrin]]: Ship's Doctor. Young Alexander Siddiq dressed in contemporary court clothing, with an eager look on his face.
- [[Holly Doc Mâ€™Benga]]: Chief Engineer. A weathered, middle aged sea dog looking lady, about Isaac's age. Black, not Tomoteloman
- [[Kala Courvoisier]]: Boatswain. A european looking woman in her thirties, clad in a [[Leonan Empire|Leonan]] deckhand's uniform
- [[Jan Utala]]: Chief of Security. A Tomoteloman man in his mid twenties in a [[Royal Tomoteloman Marines]] uniform
- [[John Merrigold]]: Quartermaster. A southern guy of average height, a strong man with a few extra pounds on him
The catgirl walks over and offers a hand to Isaac. They shake hands
> Captain Wasomun, it's an honor, I've studied your battle reports
> 
> Jack, I've heard of you. I'm glad you made it through the war.
> Well, I had to burn one of my nine lives, but we made it through

Kai introduces her as [[Carolyn Jack]], and said she served with [[The Rogue Wave]] during [[The First Revolution]]. 

The rest of the group is introduced. Leo corrects Kai when they introduce him, "It's Doctor Leo Socorrin"

Yuri rolls [[Connected]]. His relationship with Leo is...complicated. Leo thinks the world of Yuri, but Yuri finds him insufferable. They exchange greetings. 

[[Jesse Anderson|Ande]] introduces themself to Holly "I'm not much of a ship's engineer but I am a bit of a mechanic, if you'll ever need the help". Holly claps him on the back and says "there's no need to be formal around me. I appreciate someone who's straightforward and doesn't give me any guff"

Once introductions have been made, Kai sits back at their  desk and addresses the assembled [[Senior Staff]]
> This is your last, last chance to back out. What I am about to tell you is strictly confidential, from High Command

A slight pause. Nobody leaves. 

> Very well. As you may well know, [[Alliance High Command]] has decided that now is the time to escalate your push to reclaim land as the situation abroad in [[Leonan Empire|Leona]] is deteriorating. Two of the three imperial legions were recalled to [[Leonos]]. We have been at a bit of a disadvantage in terms of keeping our people supplied: while we have to ship our goods in by airship from [[The Amaranton Republic|Amaranton]], the Leonans have managed to somehow keep a sea lane open despite the presence of [[Leviathans]] in the deep ocean. It's something we've been trying to figure out for some time whilst keeping pressure on the sea lanes using pirates and corsairs. We have made some progress on this front, a Leonan scientist has contacted our spy network [[Ariadne]] claiming she wishes to defect, and has the research notes on how the empire controls the leviathans. Your mission will be to extract her and bring her safely to us. She is being held in a safe house in the capitol, the perfect trial run for our false flag operation. You will be able to freely enter the capital's port under the guise of independent merchants.

Isaac raises a concern about him and Yuri being recognized and Kai says "you're not that famous boo" (not in so many words)

Ande
> On the subject of not drawing attention to ourselves, I am a mechanic and a charioteer. How will 2 demon chariots be received on a merchant ship?

Mister Jack responds that armed merchant ships are known to carry charioteers in the ever increasing likelihood that pirates attack them for their cargo (see [[Episode 1]])

Omma asks what type of scientist the [[Dr. Vivian Nimue|defector]] is. Kai responds that she specializes in the magical science behind enchantments. No further questions.

Kai
> I will send out a more detailed dossier later. You set out in 1 week', so I suggest you use the time constructively. We will convene at [[The Presidio]] where your ship and equipment are being held.
