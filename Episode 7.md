# Downtime
## [[Infirmary or Hanger|Infirmary]]
[[Kai Lete Lawa]] asks [[Isaac Was'utala Wasomun]] why he hasn't reported for a physical. Isaac responds that he fell out of "the habit of bureaucracy" during his time with the [[Vulture Collective]], and will follow up with [[Leo Socorrin]] for his physical. Kai indicates they would have forged the documents, Isaac says it's important for the face of an operation to remain aboveboard, and he will receive a full physical examination.

# [[The Presidio]]
We find ourselves in front of [[The Invisible Hand]]. The [[crew]] of the ship is standing at attention, and Kai is also in attendance.
