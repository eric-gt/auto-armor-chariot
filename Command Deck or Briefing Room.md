COMMAND DECK OR BRIEFING ROOM

The leading player helps plan for the upcoming  [[Sortie]]: adding a d6 to the upcoming [[Plan and Prepare]]. They frame a short scene around this, either alone, or with invited characters. During the scene, anyone may spend a token to choose one:
- Contribute to the [[Plan and Prepare]], as above.
- Report on aid they’ve given to a Faction, [[Untapping]] it.
- Report on intel they’ve gathered: the Director will reveal something useful about the Sortie.
- Volunteer to take point, you'll  [[Lead a Sortie]] in [[confidence]].
