# Bio
### Name: Isaac Wasomun (Nightbird)
- Gained the moniker "Was'utala" (warbird) during his career as a Captain. He is ambivalent about it, and if you call him Was'utala to his face you'd better outrank him or be on the other end of a big gun.
### Age: 62
### Pronouns: he/him
###  Height: 6'1"

### Appearance

Aged but Distinguished. Salt and Pepper beard and medium length black-but-greying hair that looks constantly windswept. Darkly tanned complexion, crow's feet, strong but wiry build from years of clambering about rigging and long deployments with meager rations. Piercing green eyes, but everyone who knew him before [[Annexation Day]] would swear up and down they were brown...

## History
A native of [[Tomoteloma]], Isaac was born in a small fishing village in the north of the archipelago. His mother called him Wasomun, her little nightbird, because of the way he stared up at the night sky whenever he could see the stars. He was the youngest of 3 boys, and chafed under the monotony of village life. He ran away shortly after his 14th birthday, stowing away on a navy cutter that had passed through the area to collect tax for the monarchy. The captain saw promise in the young boy after he was caught and put to work on starvation rations, and brought him on as a deckhand. He climbed his way through the ranks of the Navy and was recommended to the fledgling Officers program, part of [[Tomoteloma]]'s ambition to modernize their armed forces. 

When news spread of the first [[Leviathans|leviathan]] sightings and subsequent attacks, Commander Wasomun (Isaac Wasomun, as he now called himself), was assigned as First Mate on the first airship[[Tomoteloma]] acquired, the [[Amaranton Republic|Amaranton]] made _[[Endeavor]]_. Alongside its captain, he made a name for himself as capable and formidable in both air-to-air and air-to-sea combat, and was given command of the [[monarchy]]'s second airship: a carrier named _[[Seli Pilin]]_ (Fireheart), due to its experimental petrichor engine. 

Isaac's career was that of any good officer: boring, mostly.  [[Tomoteloma]] did not  provoke many conflicts with the burgeoning [[imperial powers]], so his deployments were often just criss-crossing the archipelago to assist villages beset by leviathan 

# RELATIONSHIPS
[[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Dr. Lichtenberg]]: The PC he respects the most. No complaints about character, but the fact that she's a scientist and leviathan-touched strikes him as a liability for a senior officer of a combat airship.

[[Yuri Artorianova]]: Scum-sucking, lily-livered landlubber trying to save face and grab power. A disgrace to the mantle of warrior. I fought to have him removed from the roster but was overruled because of how he can lend legitimacy to the cover mission. Understands he was a celebrity of some kind before becoming a war-hero cum politician, but he doesn't really care about Herlock Sholmes. He prefers to read poetry and history.

[[M.C. TBD]]: Seems like a bright young greenhorn, Nothing I haven't seen before. I'll make a fine sailor/charioteer out of him, whether he likes it or not.

[[Mister Jack]]:
