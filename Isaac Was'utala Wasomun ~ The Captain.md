# RELATIONSHIPS
[[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Dr. Lichtenberg]]: The PC he respects the most. No complaints about character, but the fact that she's a scientist and leviathan-touched strikes him as a liability for a senior officer of a combat airship.

[[Yuri Artorianova]]: Scum-sucking, lily-livered landlubber trying to save face and grab power. A disgrace to the mantle of warrior. I fought to have him removed from the roster but was overruled because of how he can lend legitimacy to the cover mission. Understands he was a celebrity of some kind before becoming a war-hero cum politician, but he doesn't really care about Herlock Sholmes. He prefers to read poetry and history.

[[M.C. TBD]]: Seems like a bright young greenhorn, Nothing I haven't seen before. I'll make a fine sailor/charioteer out of him
