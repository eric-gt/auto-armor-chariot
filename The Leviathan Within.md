_One slip, that's all it takes._

Isaac can't count the times he's drilled that thought into a young sailor's head, or the times in his youth it was drilled into his. On the waves or above the clouds, the penalty for carelessness is a watery grave. Check your lifeline, watch your footing, and keep a sharp eye out for squalls and [[Leviathans|leviathan]] storms. So as he sails over the side of the [[Vulture Collective]] [[leviathan hunter|leviathan hunting]] ship into the roiling sea he feels, above all else, a sense of disappointment in himself. The great _Was'utala_, warbird of [[The First Revolution]] and scourge of [[The Royal Tomoteloman Navy]],  is going die because he got cocky during a leviathan hunt. Embarrassing.

He doesn't have time to wallow in self-pity for long. The water hits him in the chest like a jib boom on an old cutter, forcing the breath out of his lungs and shocking him back to reality. He suppresses the urge to inhale seawater and spreads his limbs out to arrest any downward momentum, a cliff diving technique he learned from an older boy with shiny black hair and eyes full of mischief, and youthful confidence. The water is pitch black and he has lost all sense of direction, until a jagged bolt of red lightning shoots across his vision and he realizes he is looking up towards the surface. He reorients and swims, his lungs screaming for air.

Breaking the surface with all the grace of a wet cat, Isaac gasps in a few breaths and looks around wildly for any sign of his ship. The running lights were extinguished in advance of the hunt, and the spotlight was shattered along with the idiot manning it who thought it would be a good idea to "blind the fucking lizard". Mercifully, a small fire appears to have started on the bridge, casting a flickering light into the darkness for Isaac to follow. He's 50, maybe 75 metres from the ship. He could be an ocean away and his odds of survival would barely change. When a man goes overboard during a leviathan hunt, he doesn't come back. He swims anyways. The light from the bridge fire bobs up and down in the swell, then jerks violently to the right, accompanied by the crunch of wood and the screech of metal as the leviathan slams broadside into the ship's hull a second time.

Another flash of lightning and in the trio of bolts Isaac finally sees the shape of the creature. It's massive, easily one and a half times longer than the hunting ship, and serpentine. The silhouette is reminiscent of an eel, or even one of the dragons he's seen illustrated in translations of eastern poetry collections. It's beautiful, just like all the others he's seen, chased, hunted. 

Killed. 

A splash in the water, maybe 10 metres to his right. Too loud and massive to be debris. Another leviathan? The wind howls and a wave crashes against wood. It's a lifeboat. A fucking lifeboat, knocked off the ship by the leviathan's assault and sent sailing over to Isaac like some kind of miracle. If he can get in, perhaps he'll stay alive long enough to truly appreciate how hopeless his situation is. They're 50 kilometres from the nearest coastline, even if he knew which way to row the leviathan would catch him well before he collapsed from exhaustion or exposure. He's an old man, lost at sea and driving forward on pure willpower and survival instinct against the insurmountable forces of Mother Nature. He might as well stop struggling and embrace his fate. His ancestors call to him, it is time for him to join them.

He reaches the lifeboat and scrambles aboard. The ancestors can wait, they know he's never been any good at giving up. Besides, he's pretty sure at least one of his aunts or uncles was the kind of person who would give h
