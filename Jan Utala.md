## Bio
Master Sergeant Utala is the quintessential solder. Always first in and last out of an engagement, he leads his Marines from the front of the charge and never leaves anyone behind. Where others might display a lust for battle that borders on barbaric, Utala is a spirited warrior with a cool head on his shoulders. He does not shy away from violence, yet neither does he embrace it. He never lets anything jeopardize the mission, and always does his best to bring everyone home alive. This makes him a fearsome opponent, with few weaknesses to exploit, and an excellent addition to any fighting force. His loyalty to [[The Tomoteloman Monarchy|the monarchy]] is unwavering, and he follows the orders of his sovereigns unfailingly.

## Captain’s Notes
_I knew the monarchy wouldn’t sanction my command without placing one of their own in the senior staff. Jan Utala is a warrior I respect, under other circumstances I would be glad to count him among my crew. However I have no doubt that he sees me as little more than a traitor. I must hope his strength of character allows him to overcome his hatred. If not, I’ll have to watch my back_
