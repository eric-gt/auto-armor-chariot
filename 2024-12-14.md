# Session 2 - Wavedashing the Dog Mech
[[Denise]] steam dashes into [[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Omma's]] mech while she's in the process of clambering into it , slamming it across the room and breaking her arm. Steam fills the room, [[Blinded|blinding]] the charioteers.

[[Andi]] is able to board her mech and power it on just as [[Gene]] rushes her. She takes [[Heat]] to counter the attack, and counter attacks with [[Nova Whip]], [[Disrupt|disrupting]] Gene's mech.

[[Isaac Was'utala Wasomun ~ The Captain|Isaac]] is being menaced by Pirates from the [[The Reaving Blade]], having just been shot by one of them. Suddenly, a [[Pirate Officer]] descends from the floor above and orders the gang to assist with taking the bridge, leaving Isaac just enough room to escape.  He ducks into the room where [[Yuri Artorianova|Yuri]] is hiding and bandages his wound, stopping the bleeding.
