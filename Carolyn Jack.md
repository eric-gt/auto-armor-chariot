## Bio
Pronouns: She/Her
Jack distinguished herself during [[The First Revolution]] as a scrappy guerilla in [[The Rogue Wave]], leading sorties against [[The Tomoteloman Monarchy|monarchy]] forces to attack key strategic operations and  disrupt critical supply lines. Her catlike augmentations complement her already heightened instincts for combat, and she is a shrewd tactician, having led several successful missions without friendly losses, and on occasion without detection. Despite her battlefield accolades,  [[The Invisible Hand]] will be her first deployment as a senior officer.

## Captain’s Notes
_Definitely someone I’d want to have around in a scrape, and I would trust her at the conn should I be incapacitated during battle. But command isn’t just about the fights you win. She’ll need to rise to the occasion on and off the battlefield  if she’s to be a good first officer, and that’s easier said than done…_
