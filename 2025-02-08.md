# Session 3
[[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Lichtenberg]], in [[Deimos]] lunges with its sword at the enemy [[Demon Chariot]] , who expertly backflips out of the way and lands on the tip of the sword, apparently using some magic to cancel out its weight. The [[Channeler]] introduces herself as  [[Calliope Calamity]], pilot of  [[Gunpowder Cassanova]].

[[Andi]] assumes an anime-ass stance and announces himself as pilot of [[The Dogged Day]].  Omma simply holds her thrust position and simply says "[[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg]]. Deimos."  Omma and CeCe exchange gunshots, each narrowly missing the other. Landing gracefully on the ground, CeCe trains a gun each on Andi and Omma and laughs: "I'll take you both on!"

Yuri and Issac attempt to take the pirate officer hostage and negotiate passage into the bridge...and it doesn't go well. The pirates open fire at Isaac, who shoots out a light and escapes to the stairwell. Yuri makes a break in the opposite direction, firing wildly. Predictably, a ricochet hits Isaac in the calf. He hides in the stairwell, dressing his wound, as Yuri discovers a back entrance to the bridge and is ushered inside by a crewmember.

Andi overcharges The Dogged Day's main gun and shoots a hole through Gunpowder Cassanova's cloak, hitting her and letting out a burst of demon water, like blood. CeCe returns fire with a salvo.
