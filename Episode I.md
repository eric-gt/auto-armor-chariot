# Summary 

During dinner with the [[Cpt. Esperanza]] of [[The Wandering Crow]], en route to [[Nokama]], a ship drops below the cloud layer and fires 2 warning shots, while signaling in Morse Code:

> _This is [[The Reaving Blade]], captained by the dread pirate [[Alfonzo Alcazar]]. Heave to and weigh anchor, we want only your cargo, not your lives_


[[Isaac Was'utala Wasomun ~ The Captain|Isaac]] calmly finishes his dinner, steals the carving knife, and begins to make his way to his chambers to retrieve his sidearm. 
[[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Omma]], [[Yuri Artorianova|Yuri]], and [[Jesse Anderson]] try to make their way to the Crow's cargo bay, but when gunshots ring out on the deck they turn around to find a boarding party attempting to take the bridge

Yuri attempts to run & hide but is spotted by the pirates, just as Isaac crosses paths with the party. He shoves him in a room and tells him to be quiet.

Andi pulls out a gun and starts blasting their way to the cargo bay, and immediately starts trying to get into their mech, [[The Dogged Day]]

Isaac is caught by the pirates and shot in the arm. He is _Bleeding_

Omma makes it to her mech, as two chariots break down the cargo bay doors. [[Denise]] and [[Gene]] are surprised to find the two Demon Chariots in the bay, and prepare for a fight
