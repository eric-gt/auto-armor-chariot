#  The Fog of War  
#### Or, Wavedashing the Dog Mech
## [[Session Notes]]
### [[Sortie]]
[[Denise]] steam dashes into [[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Omma's]] mech while she's in the process of clambering into it , slamming it across the room and breaking her arm. Steam fills the room, [[Blinded|blinding]] the charioteers.

[[Jesse Anderson]] is able to board her mech and power it on just as [[Gene]] rushes her. She takes [[Heat]] to counter the attack, and counter attacks with [[Nova Whip]], [[Disrupt|disrupting]] Gene's mech.

[[Isaac "Was'utala" Wasomun|Isaac]] is being menaced by Pirates from the [[The Reaving Blade]], having just been shot by one of them. Suddenly, a [[Pirate Officer]] descends from the floor above and orders the gang to assist with taking the bridge, leaving Isaac just enough room to escape.  He ducks into the room where [[Yuri Artorianova|Yuri]] is hiding and bandages his wound, stopping the bleeding.

[[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg| Omma]] [[Weave Magic| weaves magic]] to discern the location of her mech in the mist. She hobbles over and climbs inside the cockpit. As she powers on and connects to the [[Demon Chariot]], its [[Life Sense]] capability turns on and she can gets a bead on Gene, Denise and Andi's mech, [[The Dogged Day]]. Using her [[Alchemical Suite]], she re-knits the bones in her broken arm, and her mech stands up, ready for combat.

Andi channels magic to clear away the mist, and when Denise and Gene realize they're up against [[Channeler|channelers]] they retreat. Denise says "This is above our paygrade, we need CeCe!" [[Deimos|Deimos's]] lifesense detects a demon chariot over the ridge, just as it fires its sniper rifle. The mech's pilot says over the radio "Oh, you can see me? That's interesting."

Isaac races towards the bridge, with Yuri tailing close behind. on the deck, the two see a group of pirates trying to breach the bridge with a makeshift battering ram. They are being led by the pirate officer from earlier. Isaac surveys the situation and tells Yuri to get close to the pirates using his [[ShimmerShape clothing]] and take the officer hostage.

Andi and Omma chase the enemy mechs outside the hanger, but once disembarked Omma notices the lifesense aura of the sniper mech clamber up from supine to kneeling, then jump with impossible speed into the air, landing between the two channelers and their quarry in a shower of rose petals. This enemy Demon Chariot is decked out in a [[Leviathans|leviathan]] leather coat and poncho, with revolvers and swords strapped to a gun belt on its hips.  The charioteer's voice comes on over the radio "Well howdy there. You two got room on your dance card for lil ol' me?"
