## Bio
A rising star of the [[University]], Dr. Socorrin is on track to be among the brightest of the new generation of physicians, not just on [[Tomoteloma]], but across the world. His treatise on long term care plans of [[grafted]] patients _in situ_ was nominated for the blue ribbon at the latest _Royal Conference on Rural Medicine_ and he received top marks in his first year of trauma surgery residency. His lack of battlefield experience is noted, but given the difficulties in acquiring personnel for this mission,  his academic qualifications more than suffice for his consideration.

## Captain’s Notes
_Is this some sort of a joke? Is he even a fully qualified doctor? Am I truly supposed to put the lives of this crew in the hands of an adolescent who hasn’t so much as bandaged a wound under cannon fire? Perhaps he can anesthetize his patients for mid-air surgeries by boring them to sleep with his lecture notes_
