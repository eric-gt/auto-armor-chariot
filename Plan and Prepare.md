When you review orders for the next [[Sortie]], go over scouting reports and maps, or otherwise attempt to prepare the crew for what comes next, you’re trying to plan & prepare. Roll a d6, plus any extra dice earned during [[Downtime]] [[Scene]], and compare the results to the [[Strength]] of the [[Division]] that your next Sortie will target. For every result that is equal to or above the Division’s Strength, choose one:
During the Sortie, you will have an opportunity to;

▪ [[Untapping|Untap]] a [[faction]] of [[The Cause]]—securing supplies, freeing captives, etc

▪ Reduce a Division’s Strength by 1 during the next [[Conflict Turn]]—interfering with supply routes, undermining their operations, etc

▪ Reduce the [[GRIP]] on a Faction or [[Pillar]] by 1—rooting out agents, destroying fortifications, etc

▪ Expose or make vulnerable an asset or actor

• During the Sortie, you will have a risky opportunity to;

▪ Fell a Pillar with 0 GRIP—winning a decisive battle, capturing a position, etc

▪ Destroy or capture an exposed asset or actor

▪ Reduce a Division’s Strength by 2 during the next Conflict Turn—disrupting a key shipment, assassinating important staff, etc

• The next lead a Sortie roll is made with [[Advantage]].

• All players [[hold]] 1. You may spend your hold during the next Sortie as if it were hold gained
