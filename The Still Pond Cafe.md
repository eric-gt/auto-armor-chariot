Situated in the center of [[Nokama]], on a corner of the street, is a bright an airy, middle eastern style cafe. Electric lights dot the ceiling, there is a bar as well as nice patio seating. The coffee is notably cheaper than in the rest of the [[Tomoteloma|tomoteloman archipelago]]. The cafe's clientele is a microcosm of the island nation, attracting people from across the racial, ethnic, religious and class divides together for good food and conversation.
