The leading player rolls a d4 to see what resources they can muster, and acquires gear or equipment with a total value up to the result. They may spend extra tokens or tap [[Factions]] to increase the result by another d4, or trade objects with the [[valuable]] or [[treasure]] tags for +2 or +4 respectively. They frame a short scene around this, either alone or with invited characters.
During the scene, anyone may spend a token to choose one:

- Buy or trade for something of value, as above. 
- Start or advance a long-term project: describe what your work looks like.
- Spend time working in the field with someone you have [[GRAVITY]] with, advancing it
- Run into trouble: resolve it with moves as usual, and see what you learn.
As a reminder: smaller equipment like weapons and Astir parts have a basic cost equal to their Tier. Larger things, like [[Astirs]] and [[Ardents]], have a basic cost equal to their [[Tier]] squared. Gear with tags must balance out to 0
