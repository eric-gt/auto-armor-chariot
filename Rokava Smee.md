## Bio
Not much to say about Mister Smee. He was found in a market drunkenly cursing out the various imperial powers  and an agent of [[The Cause|the cause]] was able to spirit him to safety before he attracted too much attention. After careful vetting, it became apparent that he was  not a threat, and a particularly skilled cook with decades of maritime experience. Many of his previous vessels have been labeled pirates by some authority or another, but Smee's one loyalty seems to be whoever captains the ship he's on (as long as that Captain hates empires as much as he does)

## Captain's Notes
_If you had told me I served on a ship with this man I would have believed you. He is the epitome of a ship's "cookie": affable, skilled in a kitchen, and an utter nightmare in a chain of command. Standing orders to the quartermaster are to keep a *tight* inventory on any and all liquor in his care_
