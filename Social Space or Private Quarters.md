The leading player talks it out with another character and clears a [[peril]] of emotional or social origin from them, or they spend time with someone she has [[GRAVITY]], advancing it. They frame a short scene around this, either alone, or with invited characters.

During the scene, anyone may spend a token to choose one:
 - Talk it out and clear someone else's peril, as above.
- Encourage/demoralize someone: theyâ€™ll make their first move during the [[Sortie]] at [[Advantage]]/ [[disadvantage]].
- Spend time with someone you have [[GRAVITY]] with, advancing it.
- Rewrite a [[Hooks|Hook]], or press someone to do the same
