Pronouns: They/Them

[[Tomoteloma|Tomoteloman]] nobleperson. Resistance commander and organizer of the crew of [[The Invisible Hand]]

In [[The First Revolution]] they renounced their noble title and fought for [[The Cause]] of a free [[Tomoteloma]]. They were in a radical, far left cell. After [[Annexation Day]], they denounced their previous actions and were welcomed back into the fold of the nobility, partly because they are cousin to [[Queen Augustina Jan Lawa pi Kulupu I| the queen]]. At the start of [[The Second Revolution]], nobody is sure where their loyalties truly lie. Are they playing double agent for the cause? Or have they truly returned to the fold of [[The Tomoteloman Monarchy|the monarchy]]?
