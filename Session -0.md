[[Damien]] went over their GM style,  their systems for safety like [[Lines and Veils]], and player buy-in. We talked about characters in the abstract and learned a bunch about how [[Leviathans]] fit into the game world. I think I'm going to run the [[The Captain]] [[Playbook|playbook]], with some [[cantrips]] or [[soldier actions]] based around having a background as a [[grafted]] former [[leviathan hunter]]. I haven't figured out what I want my character to have done during [[The First Revolution]], but in the years between the end of the first and the beginning of the second, he spent his days hunting [[Leviathans]] in an airship not unlike the ones he commands now. During that time, he had a close encounter with a [[Leviathans|leviathan]] that changed him, and now he hides the mark of that creature on his body and on his soul.
