## [[Session Notes]]

### [[Downtime]]
[[Isaac "Was'utala" Wasomun]]: [[Command Deck or Briefing Room]]
Isaac takes the time to meet with each member of the [[Senior Staff]] individually, in his hotel room, at [[The Winter Palace]], walking about [[Nokama]], wherever makes sense: 
[[Jesse Anderson|Ande]] reports that she heard rumors that security in the capital is pretty business-as-usual, no dignitaries, high profile attacks, or similar
[[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Omma]] does some weather forecasting, and explains her mech's capabilities.

[[Yuri Artorianova]]; [[Somewhere Nearby]]
Yuri attempts to give Isaac an ornate gun and brag about his "suppressive fire". Isaac responds...coolly. Fails the scene and gives Isaac +1 token. Isaac advances his [[Gravity Clocks|Gravity Clock]] with Yuri.

[[Jesse Anderson]]: [[Infirmary or Hanger]]
establishing shot of a massive, turn of the century hanger in [[The Presidio]], (think The Grand Palais circa WWI). Ande walks along a line of airships in the process of being retrofitted for combat. [[Holly “Doc” M’Benga]] calls out to him, and walks him over to his [[Demon Chariot|Chariot]]. 
> I dunno what you did but I can hear the reactor hissin'. I think you cracked on of the fuel rods!

[[The Dogged Day]] is sitting in a mech hanger, much the way a dog sits.
[[Deimos]] is also there, curled up with its back open. Omma can be seen rummaging around. There are two other mechs nearby, with nobody working on them. One looks like the "Noxious Gearhulk" from MTG, the other looks like an angel with wings covered in stained glass eyes. Think "Paragon of Modernity"

Ande sets to work on the legs, studiously avoiding the body while Doc is around. Doc tells Ande that she knew his father from school, but was unaware he'd died when [[Anderson's Shop]] burned down. They talk a little shop about Demon Chariots.
