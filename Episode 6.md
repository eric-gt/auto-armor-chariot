## [[Session Notes]]

[[Isaac "Was'utala" Wasomun]]: [[Command Deck or Briefing Room]]
Isaac takes the time to meet with each member of the [[Senior Staff]] individually, in his hotel room, at [[The Winter Palace]], walking about [[Nokama]], wherever makes sense: 
[[Jesse Anderson|Ande]] reports that she heard rumors that security in the capital is pretty business-as-usual, no dignitaries, high profile attacks, or similar
