## Bio
Chief Merrigold has an eye for detail, and that has served the revolution well. His efforts to coordinate troop and supply movements for the revolution have positioned our forces for several decisive victories against forces of the [[Stahl Empire]]. He is well liked and well connected in merchant circles, and has a reputation for getting what you need before you know you need it. There have been allegations of unsavory business dealings, but prior commanders did not find evidence of any wrongdoing.
