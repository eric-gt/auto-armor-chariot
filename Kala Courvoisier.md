## Bio
Per her former Captain: “If it’s on a ship and it’s not an engine, ask Kala”. Rigging, hull plating, weatherproofing, life-support, cargo winches, nothing is outside Chief Courvoisier’s remit. One of the few senior staff recommendations with experience serving on [[Pegasus Class]] airships, she comes highly recommended as a dependable boatswain who runs a tight ship and works well with both deckhands and senior officers. After her last ship was captured and press-ganged into service by the [[Ecclisastes]], she joined the revolution so she could “stop moving cargo from here to there and do something that means something, and give the imperials a few black eyes if I’m lucky”.

## Captain’s Notes
_Dependable. Capable. Experienced. Give me ten Courvoisiers and I’ll win this damn war for you._
