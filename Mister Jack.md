## Bio
Jack distinguished herself during [[The First Revolution]] as a scrappy guerilla, leading sorties against [[The Tomoteloman Monarchy|monarchy]] forces to attack key strategic operations and  disrupt critical supply lines. Her catlike augmentations complement her already heightened instincts for combat, and she is a shrewd tactician, having led several successful missions without friendly losses, and on occasion without detection. Despite her battlefield accolades,  [[The Invisible Hand]] will be her first deployment as a senior officer.
