## Bio
Commander M’Benga is a polymath. She left a 15 year career as a physician at the outbreak of [[The First Revolution]] to establish herself as one of the greatest airship engineers in recent memory. Her field-repairs and slapdash projects have gone on to be adopted by several shipbuilders as state-of-the art systems in use in both military and civilian models. The ships she serves on have a reputation for defying the odds in speed, performance and resilience. 
## Captain’s Notes
_The irony is not lost on me that I have a perfectly capable ship’s doctor in my crew that I cannot make use of because she is too useful somewhere else. I would be a fool not to leverage her expertise and mechanical genius, but I don’t have to be happy about it _
