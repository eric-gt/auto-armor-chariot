# Session 4

_Establishing shot_ over the wing of [[The Wandering Crow]] as the sun rises over the city of [[Nokama]], a city by the bay with lush, tropical mountains rising above it. At the top of the city sits [[The Winter Palace]], refuge for the exiled [[The Tomoteloman Monarchy|Tomoteloman Monarchy]]. The city was built up around the palace during the period between the [[The First Revolution|first]] and [[The Second Revolution|second]] revolutions.

[[Andi]], [[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Omma]], [[Isaac Was'utala Wasomun ~ The Captain|Isaac]] and [[Yuri Artorianova|Yuri]] stand on the dock as porters bustle about on the docks handling their luggage. The automobiles are being unloaded from the hanger in the background, many damaged in the [[Demon Chariot|Demon]] fight between Omma, Andi and [[Calliope Calamity|CeCe]]. [[Captain Esperanza]] disembarks and thanks the 4 for their assistance. At the mention of demon chariots, Isaac perks up, not having realized the other two were [[Channeler|channelers]]. The captain shakes the other three's hands, and then gives Isaac a traditional tomateloman goodbye.
