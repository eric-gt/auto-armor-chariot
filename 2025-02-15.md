# Session 4

_Establishing shot_ over the wing of [[The Wandering Crow]] as the sun rises over the city of [[Nokama]], a city by the bay with lush, tropical mountains rising above it. At the top of the city sits [[The Winter Palace]], refuge for the exiled [[The Tomoteloman Monarchy|Tomoteloman Monarchy]]. The city was built up around the palace during the period between the [[The First Revolution|first]] and [[The Second Revolution|second]] revolutions.

[[Andi]], [[Ommatokoita Ancylos Lichtenberg|Omma]], [[Isaac Was'utala Wasomun ~ The Captain|Isaac]] and [[Yuri Artorianova|Yuri]] stand on the dock as porters bustle about on the docks handling their luggage. The automobiles are being unloaded from the hanger in the background, many damaged in the [[Demon Chariot|Demon]] fight between Omma, Andi and [[Calliope Calamity|CeCe]]. [[Captain Esperanza]] disembarks and thanks the 4 for their assistance. At the mention of demon chariots, Isaac perks up, not having realized the other two were [[Channeler|channelers]]. The captain shakes the other three's hands, and then gives Isaac a traditional [[Tomoteloma|tomateloman ]]goodbye.

Andi and Isaac take the carriage to their hotel. Omma and Yuri walk. Yuri has _way_ too much luggage, and a friendly tomateloman man comes by and insists on helping out, despite Yuri's breathless protestations. As the trio continue, they run into a woman with some young children, and then a priest, all of whom pitch in to move this insane amount of luggage up the hill. When they arrive at Yuri's hotel (it was supposed to be the fancy one but he accidentally booked the cheapest in the city), Yuri turns to tip his benefactors and finds they have already walked off. Omma looks skeptically at the hotel and Yuri says something about "being in the world". They exchange goodbyes and Omma continues up the hill to the nicer hotel where the other 3 are staying.

_Interior Shot_ Yuri sits in his hammock bed in the hotel, every flat surface taken up by his copious amounts of luggage.

Andi and Isaac's stagecoach pulls up to their hotel, a nice, Edwardian style building, and they descend. Porters whisk away their luggage and the two go to check in, and wave goodbye to one another as they head to their separate rooms. Cut to Omma walking up to the same hotel, and then cut again to her room, luggage already delivered, a comfortable space with a full size bedroom set and tall french doors opening out to a balcony that looks down over the ocean.

[[Kai Lete Lawa]] awaits the four in [[The Still Pond Cafe]]. Isaac arrives precisely on time, after waiting for a doctor to come by and change his bandage. Yuri arrives 1 or 2 minutes late. Andi is 20 minutes late. Omma arrived about 10 minutes before everyone else, including Kai. Kai arrives second, wearing a tan linen suit top and a matching lavalava. 

Isaac orders a traditional coffee and summarizes  the events of the pirate raid the night before as Andi and Yuri make their way in. Andi is so la
